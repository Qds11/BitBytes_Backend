The package is done by OOTDiffusion team. https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion

The run model file is in run/run_ootd.py and the old way is to python run/run_ootd.py. The goal is to convert run_ootd into services/OOTDiffusionService.py and be able to call the service in routes/OOTDiffusionRoute.py

## Todo
1. Test the app
